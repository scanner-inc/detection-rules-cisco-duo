name: Cisco Duo bypass code is used to authenticate user request
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a Duo bypass code is used for user authentication.

  ## Strategy
  This rule monitors successful authentication events in Cisco Duo logs with the reason set to "bypass user".

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Contact the user to confirm they used the bypass code.
  2. If the user is unaware, investigate the authentication event, focusing on the IP address, application, and user involved.
  3. If the event is malicious, initiate your organization's incident response process to contain the affected account or device.
