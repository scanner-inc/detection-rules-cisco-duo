name: Cisco Duo user marked authentication request as fraudulent
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a user marks a Duo push as fraudulent.

  ## Strategy
  This rule monitors Cisco Duo logs for instances when a user marks a Duo push as fraudulent. Users may flag a push as fraudulent if they find it suspicious, such as indicating an unusual location or application.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Contact the user to confirm why they found the push suspicious.
  2. Investigate the push event, focusing on the IP address and application involved.
  3. If the event is deemed malicious, initiate your organization's incident response process to contain the affected account or device.
